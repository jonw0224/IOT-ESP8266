Explore the Internet of Things (IoT) by experimenting with the Adafruit Huzzah module, which is based on the popular ESP8266 microcontroller. This project will delve into three distinct methodologies to showcase the versatility of the ESP8266:

Webserver: Create a custom web server using the ESP8266, allowing users to interact with and control devices over the internet.
Client-Server Architecture: Utilize the ESP8266 as a client device, connecting to Thingspeak.com, a popular IoT platform, to collect and analyze data remotely.
Custom Webserver: Write a Python-based web server to interact with the ESP8266, enabling users to control and monitor devices in real-time.
Through these three approaches, this project aims to demonstrate the potential of the ESP8266 as a foundation for building innovative IoT applications.
